# CSCU9T4-F_XMLpractical1
I have solved the following tasks using DOM

# Extension a
I added a call to the method validateDocument in the main method, passing the XSD file to be validated against.

# Extension b
I modified the exceptions to be caught to be of type SAXParseException, IOException, and SAXException. Also, to tell the user what went wrong when validating the XML file, I used the printStackTrace method for the exceptions.
